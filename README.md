# GSoC-2022-Proposal-Reviewing
.A forum to get your GSoC proposals for 2022 reviewed by experts at Coding Club, BITS Pilani

Steps to use this forum:

1. Once you have made a draft of your proposal, save it as a Google Doc and make the document sharing settings as "Anyone on the Internet can Comment".
2. Open a new issue from the issues tab, and fill out your details in the issue template. 
3. In the body of the issue, mention the link of the above Google Doc and clearly mention any points or sections that you may want to get specifically reviewed. It will make it easier for the reviewers to give you detailed feedback rather than just giving generic feedback. You may tag a specific reviewer whose comments you may want in the issue body.
4. Make sure not to open multiple issues for the same project proposal. It is absolutely necessary that a single issue exists per person per project. However, a person may open different issues for each project proposal they write.
5. Remember to be discreet and patient at all times. Your proposal may get reviewed instantly within an hour, or it may even take 3 days to get reviewed based on the availability of the reviewers. In case you do not receive a review even after 3 days, drop a polite comment in the same issue as a reminder.

Happy open-sourcing and godspeed to all of you! :))
